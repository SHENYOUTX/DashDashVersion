DashDashVersion creates predictable and opinionated [SemVer 2.0.0 version][SemVer2] numbers for [git flow][gitFlow] repositories.

It consists of an executable that can be installed as a [`dotnet` global tool][globalTool] and a reusable library [NET Standard 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) that can be used in other applications or .NET based build scripts.

## Installation

DashDashVersion can be installed as a [`dotnet` global tool][globalTool] by using the following command:

```bash
$ dotnet tool install --global git-flow-version
```

or the library part can be added as a package using:

```bash
$ dotnet add package DashDashVersion
```

## Usage

To use DashDashVersion run the command `git-flow-version` inside a git repository.
It will return a JSON string with the following properties:

* `AssemblyVersion` = an [`AssemblyVersionAttribute`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.assemblyversionattribute?view=netstandard-2.0) compatible version with the format `<major>.<minor>.<patch>.<revison>`,
* `FullSemVer` = a [SemVer 2.0.0][SemVer2] compliant version number with build metadata,
* `SemVer` = a [SemVer 2.0.0][SemVer2] compliant version number without build metadata.

For example:

```bash
$ git-flow-version
{
    "AssemblyVersion":"0.2.0.128",
    "FullSemVer":"0.2.0-dev.1+8af6c6d",
    "SemVer":"0.2.0-dev.1"
}
```

### Usage in Continuous Integration environments

If your Continuous Integration (CI) environment uses [detached heads](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout#_detached_head) `git-flow-version` cannot determine what the _type_ (`master`, `release/*`, `feature/`, `hotfix/`, `support/*`) of the branch is for which it should generate the version number. In these cases the branch name can be specified via a command-line parameter:

```bash
$ git-flow-wersion --branch develop
```

Matching of the branch name is performed using the following strategy:

* if there is a branch with the exact same name, use that branch, otherwise,
* find all branches that end with the same string as the provided parameter:
  * if all of these branches have the same _type_ use that _type_, otherwise,
  * if all of these branches have more than one different _type_ generate an error.

## Command-Line reference

The number of command-line parameters and/or options supported by `git-flow-version` is very limited, however below you find them explained in detail:

| Option                                | Value       | Description |
| :------------------------------------ | :---------- | :---------- |
| <nobr>`-?` \| `-h` \| `--help`</nobr> |             | Show the help information. |
| <nobr>`-b` \| `--branch`</nobr>       | branch name | Use the branch in the repository with the name that matches the supplied value to determine the _type_ of the branch. |
| <nobr>`-v` \| `--version`</nobr>      |             | Output only the version of the invoked `git-flow-version` executable. |

### Requirements

DashDashVersion only supports repositories that strictly follow the [git flow][gitFlow] conventions with the branch names:

* `master`
* `develop`
* `release/<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
* `feature/<feature name>`
* `hotfix/<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
* `support/<support branch name>`

this may seem overly restrictive but we believe strongly in simplicity and convention over configuration.

#### Bootstrap requirements

* A tag on `master` with a [SemVer 2.0.0][SemVer2] compliant name for the latest release, without a pre-release label and without build metadata, even if it's only a `0.0.0` at the beginning of the master branch.
* On any active `release/` or `hotfix/` branch add a tag using the  `<major>.<minor>.<patch>-rc.<number>` format if having consecutive `rc` versions is required.

### Configuration

There is nothing to configure ðŸ™Œ, you have already done the necessary configuration by adhering to [git flow][gitFlow] ðŸ˜œ.

### Keep in mind

* Only `release/`, `hotfix/`, `develop` and `feature/` branches are supported, for other branches a human has to decide on a version number.
* Make sure to tag release and hotfix branches after generating a version number, the next version number is solely reliant upon that tag.
* For unsupported branches if a tag is already present in the correct format, that version number will be returned, to facilitate rebuilds on `master` for example.

## What version number to expect

### On `develop`

The number of commits since the last release version `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` is used for the numeric part of the pre-release label. Since the content of `develop` will be in the next version of your project, the `<minor>` version number will be `1` higher than the `<minor>` number of the last release version.
For example if there are 3 commits on `develop` and the last tag on `master` is `0.0.0` the version number will be `0.1.0-dev.3`.
After performing:

```bash
$ git flow release start 0.1.0
$ git flow release finish
```
the output of `git-flow-version` will be:

```json
{"FullSemVer":"0.2.0-dev.1+8af6c6d","SemVer":"0.2.0-dev.1","AssemblyVersion":"0.2.0.128"}
```

### On a `feature/` branch

For a feature branch a version number will be calculated for the branch-off point from `origin/develop` or `develop` if there is no `origin/develop`. The number of commits on the feature branch is counted and these pieces are glued together.
For example with a feature named `featureA` with 5 commits since branching from `origin/develop` with version number `0.1.0-dev.12` the calculated version number would be `0.1.0-dev.12.featureA.5`.
If a second feature is started from the `feature/featureA` branch named `featureB` the number of commits since branching from `origin/develop` will be used, so the version number would be `0.1.0-dev.12-featureB.6`, if only a single commit is made on branch `featureB`.

### On a `release/` branch

Release candidates use a simple `+1` strategy, if the `release/0.2.0` branch has just been created and has no commits yet, the version number will be `0.2.0-rc.1`.
If there exists a tag on the release branch that has the form `0.2.0-rc.<a=highest rc number>` the calculated version number will be `0.2.0-rc.<a+1>`.
So if the last tag was `0.2.0-rc.4` the next version number would be `0.2.0-rc.5`.

### On `master`

The version number of the tag on `HEAD` will be returned if it can be found and parsed otherwise an error is generated.
